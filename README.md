# Airflow-project-1
@The aim of this airflow project is to apply some transformation rules in two different datasets and 
join them as one in a single output file using saprk and automating this process using Apache Airflow.
@This repository contains datasets,psyaprk file and Python file for Airflow code.
@In this project we are reading our input data from google cloud storage and writing
it to the output path of the same bucket of google cloud storage after transformation and joining.
